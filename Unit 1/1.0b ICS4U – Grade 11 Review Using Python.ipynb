If you understand those concepts well, then it should not be too much of a challenge to learn how to do it with Python. Below is a list of practice questions that you SHOULD be able to complete based on what you learned last year. The challenge will be that you need to code them in Python.\n",

Remember that the resources below are meant to teach programming concepts as well as syntax. You are NOT required to complete ANY of the activities inside them. They are for REFERENCE ONLY. Use as much or as little as YOU need to in order to get familiar with Python\n",
